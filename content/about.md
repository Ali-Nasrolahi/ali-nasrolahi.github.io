Hi, my name is Ali. I'm a system and infrastructure programmer with a strong passion for embedded systems and Linux. I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood and love diving into low-level programming. Lately, I've been exploring more about kernel and driver development. I'm always curious about system architecture, performance, and making things more efficient.

Welcome to my space!
