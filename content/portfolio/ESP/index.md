## Introduction

The ESP32 is a versatile and powerful microcontroller known for its robust performance and extensive support for IoT applications.
It is well-documented and provides native support for various network protocols, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (BLE), making it ideal for connected solutions.
The development environment is CMake-based, offering flexibility and ease of use, while a wealth of documentation, samples,
and community resources simplifies the learning curve and showcases its broad capabilities across different IoT projects.

## MonSys

**MonSys** is a lightweight and straightforward brokering solution designed for monitoring and controlling ESP32-supported devices.
It utilizes FreeRTOS tasks to efficiently collect data from registered handlers and propagate their responses through various communication protocols,
including HTTP, HTTPS, and MQTT.
A similar approach is used for control tasks, where each registered controller, identified by a unique address,
is accessible via an asynchronous RESTful API that proxies user requests to the appropriate handler.
Currently, secure data transmission is ensured through RESTful HTTPS, with Wi-Fi providing network connectivity.
Designed with flexibility in mind, MonSys allows key components to be easily replaced or customized to meet specific requirements,
making it highly adaptable for diverse IoT applications.

This project is based on `esp-idf`'s development environment.
