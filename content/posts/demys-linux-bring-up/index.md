## Introduction

Bringing up Linux on a System on Chip (SoC) involves multiple components working together to create a functional operating system environment.
This process requires careful selection and configuration of essential elements like the toolchain, bootloader, Linux kernel, device tree, and root filesystem (rootfs).
Each of these components plays a crucial role in enabling the hardware to boot and operate under Linux.
This post tries to explain what each component is and why it is required in the bring-up process.

## 1. Toolchain

### What is a (Cross) Toolchain?

A toolchain is a collection of tools required to compile and link software, including a compiler (e.g., GCC), linker, assembler, and related utilities. A cross-toolchain is a toolchain that runs on one architecture (host) but generates code for another architecture (target), which is essential for embedded systems and SoCs.

### Why is it Required?

Since SoCs often use architectures different from the development machine (e.g., ARM vs. x86_64), a cross-toolchain allows developers to build binaries that can execute on the target SoC.

## 2. Bootloader

### What is a Bootloader?

A bootloader is a small program that initializes the hardware and loads the Linux kernel into memory.
Common bootloaders for SoCs include U-Boot, while GRUB is used primarily on x86-based desktops and servers

### Why is it Required?

The SoC starts execution from a predefined location, often a ROM or flash memory. The bootloader sets up the memory, CPU, and essential peripherals before transferring control to the Linux kernel. It also enables features like network booting and firmware updates.

## 3. Linux Kernel

### What is the Linux Kernel?

The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system, managing hardware resources, scheduling processes, and providing essential system services.

### Why is it Required?

The kernel abstracts hardware details, allowing user-space applications to interact with the system without needing direct hardware access. It manages memory, file systems, networking, and process execution, making it the foundation of a functional system on an SoC.

## 4. Device Tree

### What is a Device Tree?

A Device Tree (DT) is a data structure that describes the hardware components of a system to the Linux kernel. It is typically written in Device Tree Source (DTS) format and compiled into a Device Tree Blob (DTB).

### Why is it Required?

Device Trees are essential for SoCs as many peripherals are connected via buses that do not support automatic enumeration, such as SPI, I2C, and memory-mapped registers.
Unlike PCIe or USB, which allow dynamic device discovery, SoCs often require explicit hardware descriptions through the device tree to enable proper driver initialization

## 5. Root Filesystem (Rootfs)

### What is a Root Filesystem?

The root filesystem contains essential system libraries, binaries, and configurations required for a functional **user space**. It can include package managers, shell utilities, and custom applications.

### Why is it Required?

Without a root filesystem, the kernel alone cannot provide a complete operating system environment. The rootfs enables **user interaction**, **application execution**, and **system configuration**, making it a critical component of the bring-up process.

## Build Systems

### What are Build Systems and How Do They Help?

Build Systems provide a framework for configuring, building, and packaging the Linux kernel, device drivers, libraries, and applications, allowing developers to create a minimal and optimized operating system image that meets the specific requirements of their hardware. By managing dependencies and providing recipes or configuration files, these build systems streamline the development process, ensure compatibility with the target SoC, and facilitate the integration of various software components, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and reliable Linux boot-up on embedded devices. Two of the most common used build systems include **Yocto Project** and **Buildroot**.

### Yocto Project

The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project that provides a flexible framework for creating custom Linux-based operating systems for embedded and IoT devices. It offers a set of tools, metadata, and best practices to help developers build, customize, and maintain Linux distributions tailored to specific hardware platforms, including System on Chips (SoCs). With its modular architecture, the Yocto Project allows users to select and configure software components, manage dependencies, and generate optimized images, making it easier to develop and deploy embedded systems while ensuring compatibility and scalability across diverse hardware environments.

### Buildroot

Buildroot is another open-source tool that simplifies the process of building custom Linux-based operating systems for embedded systems.
It provides a straightforward and efficient framework for compiling the Linux kernel, libraries,
and applications into a single, minimalistic root filesystem tailored to specific hardware platforms, including System on Chips (SoCs).
With its user-friendly configuration interface, Buildroot provides a streamlined way to generate minimal Linux root filesystems with fixed configurations but *lacks* the package management and advanced configurability offered by Yocto.

## Conclusion

Linux bring-up on SoCs is a multi-step process involving key components such as the toolchain, bootloader, kernel, device tree, and root filesystem. Understanding each componentâ€™s role is essential for a successful embedded Linux deployment. Build systems like Yocto and Buildroot further streamline this process by automating the integration and build steps. For deeper insights, refer to [Further Reading](#further-reading). Thanks you!
