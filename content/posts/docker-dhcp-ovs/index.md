## Introduction

While Docker's built-in networking provides convenience for container communication, its default bridge networking model can be limiting for advanced use cases. When integrating containers into existing network infrastructure—particularly in environments using Open vSwitch (OVS) or requiring external DHCP services—greater control over network configuration becomes essential.

This guide demonstrates how to:

- Decouple containers from Docker's default networking
- Integrate container interfaces directly with Open vSwitch
- Delegate IP assignment to an external DHCP server

This approach enables containers to participate in your network as first-class citizens, compatible with existing VLAN configurations, network policies, and monitoring systems.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide effectively, you should understand:

- **Linux network namespaces**  
  Containers leverage kernel namespaces to maintain isolated network stacks, including interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules.

- **Docker networking fundamentals**  
  Familiarity with Docker's bridge networks, overlay networks, and the `docker network` command family.

- **Open vSwitch (OVS) architecture**  
  Understanding of OVS bridges, ports, and flow tables is recommended for production implementations.

- **DHCP protocol operation**  
  Knowledge of DHCP discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgment (DORA) process.

For reference materials, see the [References](#references) section.

## Container Networking Fundamentals

Containers rely on several Linux kernel features for network isolation:

1. **Network namespaces** - Provide isolated network stacks
2. **veth pairs** - Virtual Ethernet devices that connect namespaces
3. **Control groups (cgroups)** - Manage resource allocation

When Docker creates a container with `--network=none`, it establishes:

- A new network namespace
- Only the loopback interface (`lo`)
- No default route or external connectivity

This blank slate allows for custom network configuration while maintaining other container isolation properties.

## Solution Architecture

Our approach involves:

1. Container initialization without Docker networking
2. Manual veth pair creation
3. OVS bridge integration
4. External DHCP assignment

### Step 0: Environment Verification

Confirm your environment meets these requirements:

- Docker Engine installed (v20.10+ recommended)
- Open vSwitch installed (`ovs-vsctl` available)
- Pre-configured OVS bridge with uplink connectivity
- DHCP server reachable from bridge network
- Administrative privileges (sudo/root access)

### Step 1: Launch Container Without Network

Start a disposable Alpine Linux container with no network stack:

```bash
docker run --rm --network=none -dit --name ovs-dhcp-test alpine ash
```

### Step 2: Establish veth Connectivity

1. Identify the container's process ID:

```bash
CONTAINER_PID=$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' ovs-dhcp-test)
```

2. Create the veth pair:

```bash
ip link add veth-host type veth peer name veth-cont
ip link set veth-cont netns $CONTAINER_PID
```

3. Verify interface in container namespace:

```bash
nsenter -t $CONTAINER_PID -n ip link show
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Open vSwitch

1. Add host interface to OVS bridge:

```bash
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 veth-host
ip link set veth-host up
```

2. Activate container interface:

```bash
nsenter -t $CONTAINER_PID -n ip link set veth-cont up
```

### Step 4: DHCP Configuration

For Alpine containers (using `udhcpc`):

```bash
nsenter -t $CONTAINER_PID -m -n -- udhcpc -i veth-cont -f -q
```

For Debian/Ubuntu containers (using `dhclient`):

```bash
nsenter -t $CONTAINER_PID -m -n -- dhclient -v veth-cont
```

**Security Note:** Prefer `nsenter` over `--privileged` containers for network configuration to maintain principle of least privilege.

### Verification

Confirm network functionality:

```bash
docker exec ovs-dhcp-test ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
docker exec ovs-dhcp-test ip addr show veth-cont
```

## Conclusion

This integration pattern provides several advantages:

- **Network Consistency** - Containers behave like traditional hosts
- **Infrastructure Integration** - Leverages existing DHCP and switching infrastructure
- **Policy Enforcement** - Enables OVS flow rules and QoS policies
- **Visibility** - Container traffic appears in standard network monitoring

While more complex than Docker's default networking, this approach is invaluable when containers must participate in broader network architectures.
